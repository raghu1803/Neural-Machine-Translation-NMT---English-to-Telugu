This repository contains an implementation of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model that translates English sentences into Telugu. The model is built using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture with an encoder-decoder structure and LSTM layers. The project uses a dataset of English-Telugu sentence pairs for training, with data preprocessing to clean and tokenize the text. The model is trained using Keras with TensorFlow backend, and includes early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing to optimize performance. The repository also contains scripts to train, evaluate, and test the model, along with the ability to decode new English sentences into Telugu.
